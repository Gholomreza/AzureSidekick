# AzureSidekick (Team Foundation Sidekicks Enhanced Edition)

This project is an enhanced version of Team Foundation Sidekicks, originally developed by Attrice Corporation.

## Features
- Seamless integration with Azure DevOps 2022
- Bug fixes for improved stability and performance
- Streamlined workflows for enterprise Azure DevOps and TFS environments
